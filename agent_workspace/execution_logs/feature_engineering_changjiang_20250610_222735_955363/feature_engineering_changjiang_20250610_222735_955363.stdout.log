--- Step 1: Load Mask and Prepare Time Index ---
Mask loaded. Spatial shape: 144x256. Yangtze River basin points: 2943
Time range from 2016-01-01 to 2020-12-31. Total days: 1827
--- Step 2: Generate and Save Time Features ---
Saved 长江_sin_day_of_year.npy and 长江_cos_day_of_year.npy
Saved seasonal one-hot features.
--- Step 3: Process Product by Product ---

--- Step 4: Calculate Multi-Product Synergy Features ---
Not all product raw data was loaded successfully. Skipping multi-product synergy features and dependent features.
--- Step 5: Calculate High-Order Interaction Features ---
Skipping some high-order interaction features due to missing dependency: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sandbox/outputs/长江特征工程/长江_std_all_products.npy'
--- Feature Engineering Complete ---
